# Internship Repository

Welcome to the internship repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for the internship tasks and projects. Below, you'll find an overview of the repository structure, the purpose of each directory, and how branches are used for different tasks.

## Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the main directories in this repository:

1. `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the projects and tasks. Each task will have its own subdirectory and relevant code will be placed accordingly.


## Branch Organization

I use a branching strategy to manage the development process for different tasks. Here's how branches are organized:

1. `main`: The `main` branch represents the stable version of the code. It contains the latest release that has been tested and reviewed.

2. Task Branches: For each task or project, we create a separate branch. The branch name follows the convention `task/<task-name>`. For example, if the task is "git-story," the branch will be `git-story/feature-a`.
